# VP_Supervisor

An Unreal Engine Editor Utility widget (and demo level) to help Virtual Production Supervisors and Engine Ops teams:
 - Quickly move their camera or nDisplay (NDC Volume) into position shotlist setups
 - Convert large groups of identical static meshes into a more efficient "Hierarchical Instanced Static Mesh" (and back again)
